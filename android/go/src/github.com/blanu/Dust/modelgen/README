Dust/go contains a compiler for the Dust statistical model specification to Go
Though the output is a Go library, the compiler is written in Python.
You therefore need both Go 1.4 and Python 2.7.6 in order to run the compiler.

An important thing to understand is that there is no one single Dust library
for Go. You use the Dust compiler to generate a custom Dust library for your
specific models.

Therefore in order to use Dust you must provide your own models.
Once you have compiled your models you will have a custom Dust library.
No executable binaries are produced, only a library.
In order to use this library you will need to integrate it into an application.

This is not proxy software. It is not suitable for use by end users.
It is a tool for developers to use to create new filtering circumvention tools.

If you would like to use your custom Dust library in an application, please do
so. If you would like advice on doing this, feel free to contact us.
