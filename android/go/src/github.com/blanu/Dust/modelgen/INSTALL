Put your model files in a dedicated directory.
You cannot build without model files.
You must provide your own model files!

Run ./build.sh [language] [model-directory] [go-package-path] [corresponding-code-directory]

Example: ./build.sh go ~/foo-models/ foo.example/our_models ~/go/src/foo.example/our_models

For testing with DustProxy with the privmodels option, use the following package path:
  caolta3iaejox3z4madc5wmp4z.uuid/Dust_privmodels
