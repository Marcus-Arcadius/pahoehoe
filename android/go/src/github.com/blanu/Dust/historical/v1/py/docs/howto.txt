How do I use Dust Lite services?

Dust Lite works just like normal Dust, only there is no need to use invites. Consequently, it lacks the security of normal Dust.

To run a Dust Lite server, run commands/lite-serv.py port 6/4
To send mail with a Dust Lite server, run command/lite-mmail-send.py inport outport 6/4

What Dust services are available?

By default, mail and chat are included. The mail service acts as a proxy which let's you send normal mail messages to a list of allowed destination hosts.
Chat is a simple service for debugging which prints received messages on the server's console.
New services can be added easily by editting server/services.py.
